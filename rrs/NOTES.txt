Add some notes here.

=========================
[April 29, 2014 Tuesday] To everyone:
Someone might need to change the configuration in rrs/settings.py to correctly point to our database, and add their team's apps to the Django project. Login can now be accessed via “http://127.0.0.1/login”. Do note that it will just display a message. No functionality but the message is a start. Happy coding.
