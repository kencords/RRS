Add some notes here.

To everyone:
Someone might need to change the configuration in rrs/settings.py to correctly point to our database, and add their team's apps to the Django project. Login can now be accessed via “http://127.0.0.1/login”. Do note that it will just display a message. No functionality but the message is a start. Happy coding.

TO everyone:
Almost fixed the repo. You may type in the command "python manage.py runserver 8080" and visit "http://127.0.0.1/login" to view the temporary login look. Visiting "http://127.0.0.1:8080" will say Page Not Found because the homepage hasn't been defined yet in the URLConf.

To the Layout team:
You may wanna create the homepage layout now. :)
Here, grab the link below. Hope it might help you with the layouting. Good luck by the way.

To Limher, specifically:
Limher, if you read the message above and that I gave the layout team a resource to look at, please don't be jealous. I found the resource by accident and thought that the layout team may find some use with link. I'll find some links for your team if ever I find another resourc by accident.

Happy coding. :)
